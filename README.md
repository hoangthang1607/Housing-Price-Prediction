# Housing-Price-Prediction

This small project studies the relationship between Housing price and others features such as location, surfaces and others facilities.
Then models of constructing predicted price are built based on several algorithms: basic Neural Network (linear regression with regularization, non-linear ReLU hidden layer), Tree-based models (bagging/boosting ensemble) and Support Vector Machine (different kernels)
